# Genome_Sequence_Reverter
Software Engineering Team Project

### Project Details
A web software project, which will be developed with following capabilities:
* Find complementary strings of DNA
* Convert DNA strings to RNA
* Convert RNA string to Protein 
* Design primers for PCR
* Search for gene strings within Genome
* Find point mutations between the DNA strings
* Get nucleotide statistics withing DNA string
* Perform format conversions (ex: from FASTA to EMBL)
* Find restriction sites and provide appropriate restriction enzyme names
* Find CpG Islands withing DNA
* Draw a restriction site map of a plasmid
* Shuffle DNA / protein, generate random DNA / protein
